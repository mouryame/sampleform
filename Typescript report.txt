It has a very different folder structure, It doesn't have index.js and App.js in its root folder, it consists of a folder named apps, that has multiple
apps in it. 

Checked the the-crew-ui folder in the apps folder, since that was supposed to be the front end part of this application, even this folder doesn't have
index.js and app.js in its root folder, but this contains a source folder.

The source folder of the-crew-ui consisted of main.tsx instead of index.js or index.tsx, the app is being rendered in this file.

App.tsx is present in the app folder inside the source folder, this app folder consists of all the components, assets, services etc..., the redux store
and slices are also present inside this app folder.

All the types are defined inside the types folder present inside the apps folder. Types are defined as class, with constructors in it.

Every folder consisted of index.tsx file in which multiple components from all the folders are imported to and exported from.

It also has a folder named models that contains mutiple classes defined.

Actually lib folder inside src has different folders that has mulptiple classes defined.
Inside the types folder that's in src, different interfaces were defined.

I've get more idea about redux thunk.

I understood this app is an ecommerce app by looking into the code
